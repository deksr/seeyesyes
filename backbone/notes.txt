MODELS
Models can be created by extending `Backbone.Model`
The initialize() method is called when a new instance of a model is created.

Model.get() provides easy access to a model’s attributes.
Model.set() sets a hash containing one or more attributes on the model.

If you need to read or clone all of a model’s data attributes, use its toJSON() method.
